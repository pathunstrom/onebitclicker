# 1-Bit Clicker Jam

Rebuild **Auto-miner** reducing the complexity of the idea.

## Theme

Auto-miner is based on a lonely existence as the foreman on an automated mining
vessel in space. Your only companions are the drones you put into service
among your various claims.

## Mechanics

Unlike traditional clickers, high click rate is less valuable than planning
and building.

Very time intensive.

### The Ship

The place to manage your operation: *Purchase* *claims* and *drones*, *sell*
the things you mine.

When you have multiple *claims* it takes time to move between them.

Upgrades can include: *Ship capacity*, *drone capacity*, *ship speed*,
business themed upgrades?

### Logistics Drone

The primary click interface centers on a *Sell* button.

Your *Logistics Drone* fills its hold to capacity and returns to society to
sell your mined goods. This takes some period of real time. Your *Account* is
not updated until your *Logistics Drone* returns from a sale.

Upgrade possibilities for the *Logistics Drone* can include *speed* and
*capacity*.

### Mining Drone

Your mining drones detach from your ship and search *Fields* for things to 
mine. This takes some amount of real time based on the *flight speed* of the
*Drone* and the *depth* of the *Field*.

Possible upgrades can include *flight speed*, *capacity*, and *mining speed*. 

### Fields

A field is a mining claim of asteroids or other stellar body. Mechanically, a
field has a *depth* stating how much of it has been mined, and a *density* 
that determines how much can be mined per *layer* of *depth*.

### Claims

A claim represents the right to mine a specific *Field*. The *quality* of the
claim relates to the average *density* of the *Field*.

Claims can be *purchased* and *sold*.

## Stories

### MVP

#### I can send my logistics drone to sell things.

*By pressing a button, my logistics drone can remove things from my ship's hold
and travel to sell them.*

#### I can purchase drones

Given a number of slots to fill, I can buy drones to mine for me.

#### I can view my money

*I have a UI element where I can view my current money.*

#### I can view my current ore

*I have a UI element where I can see my current ore.*

#### I can view the current field depth

*There is a way to view the current depth of the mining field.*

### Future

#### I can purchase a claim.

I should be able to use the interface to find and purchase a single claim from
a small selection.

I should be able to select from my available claims to move to them.
